## Problem
Measure a force of a pinch and display it's value. When the max value is reached, give user feedback using LED's.

## Usage
- Pinch a force sensor and the LED's will show the level of force; 
- Press a button, to reset the LED'S, when they are in 'animation' state.

## Future improvements
- Use hardware interrupts, to detect button press.
