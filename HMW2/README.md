## Problem
Measure light level of an area and display it's value. Give a user an option, to stop device from updating a display value. Everything should work asynchronously.

## Usage
- Press a button, to freeze display with it's current value;
- When display is frozen, the blue LED will light up.

## EEPROM
Everything is saved in a form of a struct:
- Magic number (int);
- Display state (int);
- Displayed sensor value (int).

## Timer
- 

## Future improvements
- Use an LCD screen instead of 7-segment display, to show more information;
- Implement debouncing for a push button, for less double-clicks;
- More sensors, for more averaged out value.
